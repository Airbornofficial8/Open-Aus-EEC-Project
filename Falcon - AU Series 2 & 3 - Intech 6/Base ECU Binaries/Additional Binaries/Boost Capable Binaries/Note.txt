!!!EXPERIMENTAL - EXPERIMENTAL - EXPERIMENTAL!!!


Use the Latest NGIC9 Definition with this file (First Compatable version is v1.2)

This file is from my project turbo AU and has been preconfigured to run a turbocharged setup using a 2.5-bar BA Turbo MAP sensor.
You are welcome to use this as a base in your turbocharged application, I take no account for any damages you do using this base tune.
The base tune SHOULD be edited further to match your setup.

In this tune:
-Patch code was applied to scale VE with Map
-Patch code was applied to disable ALL C/L fueling behaviours
-Everything known has been rescaled for you already

-This tune at the time of uploading is what I use as the tune for my car
