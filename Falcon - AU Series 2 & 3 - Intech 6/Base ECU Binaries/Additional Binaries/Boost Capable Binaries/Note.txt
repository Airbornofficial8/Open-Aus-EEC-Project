!!!EXPERIMENTAL - EXPERIMENTAL - EXPERIMENTAL!!!


USE CAUTION WHEN ATTEMPTING TO RUN THIS BINARY AND DEF. ISSUES WILL LIKELY EXIST!


Boost Capable Binaries provide more features for boosted AU applications than other binaries.

Current version is: 0.1 Alpha

Features:
-Enables up-to 200% VE Load without any hacks or workarounds while maintianing a 0.5% step size
-Configured out of the box to work with the 2 bar XR6t OEM Map sensor available from Ti Performance
-Table scalers already tweaked for you to handle up-to 14 psi of positive pressure.

Downsides:
-Airmass Flow Multiplier is no longer configurable
-Load beyond 200% is fully unsupported. No additonal hacks to achive more load are possible
-This binary impliments an existing known hack in a more user friendly way and is not a full solution.
