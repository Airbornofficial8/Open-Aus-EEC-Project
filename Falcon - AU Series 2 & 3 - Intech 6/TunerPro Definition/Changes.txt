NGIC9 Extended Changelist:

Version 0.3 - First Release intended for public via TiPerformance

-Defined Functions for Idle Spark Correction's
-Descriptions for all known components + Table Scalers linked wherever possable
-Correction to convert Torque managemnet values into Newton Meters
-(NGIC9 Only) Fixed AT Transmission Tables, Only N9XJ4 has shift offset tables, NGIC9 does not.
-Located Spark Upper and Lower Clip Scalers which were only available previously in EL or older XDFs but were still limiting spark in N9XJ4 and NGIC9.
-Various other tweaks


Version 0.31

-Reverse engineered some items from NGVB5 matching there data to NGIC9, such as:
	*ACT Fraction for ECT/ACT for Startup and Warmup fuel tables
	*Fallback ISC Duty if Load (MAF/MAP sensor) fail + TPS fail
	*Fallback Desired RPM if above condtions
	*Diff Ratio
	*Also pending adding some Idle Scalers in v0.32
-Added Final Shift Pressure Multiplier
-Added 2 flags for LPG Fitted & LPG Dedicated Mode. Which affect the EEC operation in relation to LPG.
-Added some items that are being checked / tested


Version 0.4

-Reverse engineered many items from American SD bins relating to various features
-Applied small tweaks and corrected minor issues


Version 0.41

-Arranged items in H/W Configuration into subfolders and added misplaced items in Fueling and Limits folders into H/W Configuraiton subfolders
-Provided descriptions for some H/W Config items
-Updated Minimum Acceptable Engine Torque function with a new correction to correctly display NM torque
-Added Enter Minimum Torque mode and Exit Minimum Torque mode rpm scalers
-Added Torque Frixtion Loss for ECT table which subtracts estimated Torque for cold ECT
-Corrected naming for Transmission Line Pressure tables. They are shift adders not Base Pressure Values
-Some other fixes and tweaks


Version 0.42

-Added new items for controlling the IMRC system
-Fixed IMRC open and closed tables (Added Row and Columm funcitons, created correciton formula)
-Some new items in Misc section being tested
-2 new multipliers added for sensor final values (Sensor 5 - TP Volts? and Sensor 6)


Version 0.43

-Corrected some small issues with incorrectly identified tables.
-Added shift pressure offsets for Transmission Temperature and Current Gear (Pending Testing).
-Added Adaptive Shift Threshold RPM scaler.
-Added Adaptive Shift Base Target Shift Time Table.
-Added new Table Scalers.


Version 0.50

-Changed descriptions of the Main Fuel Tables after verifying there actual behavour with a Moats QH.
-Changed some correction formulas on scalers and tables after doing payload verification with the QH. Notably the Injector PW formula which is X/128 now.


Version 0.51

-Polish up for first upload to GitHub Repo. Some Name and Description cleanup.

Version 1.1

-Built from Version 0.51 which became v1.0
-Corrected the Minimum IMRC AM tables to there actual purpose, Minimum Knock Noise to Validate
-Fixed issue with Spark Tables Being Unsigned
-Deleted Disable IAC flag as it was actually a flag for the Security System
-Tweaked names of some items to better reflect there purpose
-Thank you to Ronald Polzin & Kyle Hald from (Facebook) J3 chip users for the first official bug report!

Version 1.11
-Added Debyma Desired Tables (Base Deyma = Base Desired Idle Air Mass)
-Added Scalers for Desired Debyma Tables
