# Open Australian Electronic Engine Control (IV & V) Project
Welcome to the Open Aus EEC Project! The main goal of this project is to make publiclly available our current best definitions, information and understanding of Australian Ford Electronic Engine Control Systems. This engine control system is most notably used in the very popular EA to AU Falcons but was also present in other cars like the X series Falcons or even other Fords of the era.
