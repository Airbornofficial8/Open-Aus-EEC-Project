# Open Australian Electronic Engine Control (IV & V) Project
Welcome to the Open Aus EEC Project! The main goal of this project is to make publiclly available our current best definitions, information and understanding of Australian Ford Electronic Engine Control Systems. This engine control system is most notably used in the very popular EA to AU Falcons but was also present in other cars like the X series Falcons or even other Fords of the era.

## Read the Issues Tab FIRST!
Before Downloading the Repo and trying the enhanced XDFs, I would highly recommend checking the issues tab to ensure you are aware of the outstanding issues with the XDFs or patched binaries before trying them on your own hardware. I take no responsibility for damage to your EEC or engine due to use of the binaries and definitions here. They are a work in progress!

## Version 2.0 XDFs are on the way
Version 2.0 XDFs are now coming! These XDFs will replace the existing beta versions available now. They have solved all the current known issues and an additional wealth of configurable items have been added. With version 2.0, AU owners can expect:

-Full control of the Tip-In spark retard system
-Further Access to HEGO related settings, including Jumpback, Ramp and Transport Delay Multipliers enabling further calibration of the factory narrowband
-Access to the Anti-Overheat system configuration, used to disable cylinders when the cylinder head is criticlly overheated.
-Further access to torque management including scalers for configuring the traction control system and configuring spark retard and cylinder cutting
-Access to further idle settings, like base DEBYMA tables and DEBYMA correction for idle speed error + further access to closed loop idle settings like intergrator intensity when engine underspeed / overspeed, etc.
-Access to fallback defaults for various sensors, functions for Alpha-N fallback fueling and controls for behaviour under failure condtions.
-Access to settings for the EGR and canister purge system
-Further control of the BTR automatic transmission.

## Navigating this Repo
This Repo contains various files and information relating to the above mentioned vehicles and their EEC ECUs. This includes definition files, Disassembly listings with various levels of commenting, ADX files for logging the EECs via a Moates QH (should you own one) and any other related information.
